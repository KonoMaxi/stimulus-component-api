# Stimulus-Component-API Proof-of-Concept

This small Proof-of-Concept (PoC) shows examples for utilizing the StimulusJS lifecycle-hooks to mount JS-Components and persisting State in the DOM using the StimulusJS Value-API. This project implements examples with Vue v2, Vue v3, Svelte and React.

Have a look at the live demo on https://stimulus-component-api.konow.ski/!

## Testdrive
You can also fiddle around with the source-code.

```
yarn
yarn dev
```
Hint: use node 14+ (yarn will also yell at you in case something is wrong)

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and play with the buttons / components.
